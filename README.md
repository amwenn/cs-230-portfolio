CS 230 Software Design Portfolio

This repository contains portfolio artifacts from CS 230: Operating Platforms at Southern New Hampshire University. The course focused on analyzing operating platforms, system architectures, memory and storage management, distributed systems, and security considerations for modern software applications.

The primary project in this repository is based on the client scenario The Gaming Room and their web-based game application Draw It or Lose It. The work demonstrates how system architecture decisions support scalability, performance, security, and cross-platform compatibility.
